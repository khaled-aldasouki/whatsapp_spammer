# Whatsapp_Spammer
A simple automation tool for sending bulk messages to someone on WhatsApp 

## NOTICE
***Spam could be a violation of the Whatsapp Terms of Service, therefore any consequences resulting from the use of this tool is the users fault alone. Developers are NOT responsible for any issues arising from the use of this tool.***

Pyinstaller, which is used to create the executable file, does not support the "typing" module, which is why the "Start with image" functionality has been disabled and removed from the program. Furthermore, the spammer does not support image spam to avoid cyber attacks aimed at, for example, filling up the targets storage. Future releases may implement similar features once security measures have been taken.
